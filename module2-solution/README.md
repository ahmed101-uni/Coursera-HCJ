# Module 2 Solution – Responsive Page

This is the solution for **Module 2 Coding Assignment** from the Coursera course: [HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers).

## 📄 Project Description

The goal of this assignment is to create a **responsive single-page website** that adapts its layout based on the screen size of the device being used. The layout mimics three mockups: **desktop**, **tablet**, and **mobile**, using only HTML and CSS (no frameworks allowed). The project demonstrates the use of:

- Media queries
- Floating elements
- Relative and absolute positioning
- Box model (`box-sizing: border-box`)
- Responsive design with percentage widths

## 🔧 Folder Structure

module2-solution/ │ ├── index.html └── css/ └── styles.css


## 📐 Breakpoints Used

- **Desktop**: `≥ 992px`
- **Tablet**: `768px – 991px`
- **Mobile**: `≤ 767px`

## ✅ Features Implemented

- Responsive layout with one page only
- Page heading and 3 content sections: Chicken, Beef, Sushi
- Section layout varies by screen size:
  - **Desktop**: All 3 sections side-by-side
  - **Tablet**: 2 sections in the first row, 1 in the second
  - **Mobile**: All sections stacked vertically
- Section titles are always positioned at the **top-right** corner
- Each section and its title region has a **distinct background color** and a **1px black border**
- Adequate spacing (padding and margins) and content alignment to avoid overlap
